# Scripts for IPTC Photo and Video Metadata

Here you can find scripts for processing IPTC Photo Metadata or IPTC Video Metadata Hub data:

- folder photometadata: for the [IPTC Photo Metadata Standard](https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/iptc-standard/)
- folder videometadata: for the [IPTC Video Metadata Hub Recommendation](https://iptc.org/standards/video-metadata-hub/recommendation/)

The folders have README files with more specific information.

Python scripts and Powershell scripts are available.

The scripts use the [exiftool](http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) software for embedding metadata to photo or video files, or for retrieving it.

# IPTC Standards

The standards for metadata of photos or videos are developed and maintained by [IPTC](https://iptc.org), the global standards body for news media.

# About

The scripts are created and maintained by Michael Steidl, the Lead of the IPTC [Photo Metadata](https://iptc.org/about-iptc/work-structure/#pmd) and [Video Metadata](https://iptc.org/about-iptc/work-structure/#vmd) Working Groups.

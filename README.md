Scripts for IPTC Photo and Video Metadata

Here you can find scripts for processing IPTC Photo Metadata and IPTC Video Metadata Hub data:

- folder photometadata provides them for the IPTC Photo Metadata standard
- folder videometadata provides them for the IPTC Video Metadata Hub recommendation

Currently these are only Python 3.5 (or higher) scripts.

The scripts use the [exiftool](http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) software for embedding metadata to photo or video files, and retrieving them from there.
